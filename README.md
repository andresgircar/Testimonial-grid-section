## Welcome to my solution of "testimonial grid section" challenge  :tw-270f:

This challenge was taken from frontendmentor.io you can check it out [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un77 "here")

I made this challenge using html + css coding. The objective was mainly putting in practice CSS Grid positioning and some other styles.

I am newbie with web development as you can see but I tried to keep and use the best practices and comments to the styles and its hierarchy

Feel free to check the code and giving back any suggestion or feedback!!
